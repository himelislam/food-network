                <h4>Air Fryer Crab Rangoon</h4>
                <p>The appeal of crab Rangoon is the contrast between the crispy fried wonton wrappers and melty cheese and crab filling. Making the popular American Chinese restaurant appetizer whose origins are traced back to Trader Vic’s Polynesian-themed restaurant at home just got easier thanks to the air fryer.</p>

                <h4>Slow-Cooker Peppers</h4>
                <p>Stuffed bell peppers have never been simpler to prepare, thanks to your slow cooker! Just stir all the filling ingredients together (raw ground beef included), then stuff the mixture into the peppers and let the cooker do the rest. Top with sour cream for a comforting, nourishing dinner your whole family will love.</p>

                <h4>The Best Pot Roast</h4>
                <p>The secret to a flavorful pot roast is browning the meat and onions before roasting, which adds a rich meaty flavor and caramelized sweetness. This step is what separates our recipe from many others that use a slow cooker. And also unlike a slow cooker recipe, our sauce is simmered to reduce a little which concentrates the flavors.</p>
